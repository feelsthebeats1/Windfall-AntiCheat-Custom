## How to Submit a Contribution

### Small Fixes (typos, broken links, obvious errors)

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/typo-in-readme`
3. Make the fix
4. Commit with the correct format (see below)
5. Push and open a PR

### Substantial Contributions (new checks, major features)

**Open an issue first** to discuss your idea before investing time. This ensures your contribution aligns with Windfall's goals and avoids duplicate work.

When proposing a new anti-cheat check, include:
- What cheat behavior does it detect?
- How does it work at the packet level?
- What MC versions should it support?
- Are there known false positive scenarios?

---

## Commit Message Format

Windfall uses a strict commit format. **This is enforced by the CI release workflow.**

### Format

```
V:x.y.x + Short summary
```

### Rules

- **`V:`** prefix — capital V, colon, no space before version
- **`x.y.x`** — version from pom.xml (you MUST bump pom.xml version before committing)
- **`+`** separator
- **Summary** — 3-8 words describing the change

### Examples

```
V:1.9.2 + Fix ReachCheck memory leak
V:1.10.0 + Add new VelocityCheck
V:1.10.1 + Update thread safety
V:1.11.0 + Add PhaseCheck for wall clipping
```

### What NOT to do

```
fix: something              (wrong format)
v1.9.2 fixed bug            (lowercase v, no colon)
V:1.9.2                     (no summary after +)
Update README               (no version prefix)
```

**Note:** Only commits matching `V:x.y.x + Summary` trigger a GitHub Release. The CI extracts the version and creates a tag `v1.9.2`.

---

## Code Style

### General Rules

- **Java 11 only** — no Java 12+ features (no `var`, no `switch` expressions, no text blocks)
- **Target Java 11** — `pom.xml` uses `source=11, target=11`
- **No external dependencies at runtime** — PacketEvents is provided, never shaded
- **Reflection over version checks** — when calling version-specific APIs, use reflection with try/fallback patterns

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Check classes | `PascalCaseCheck` | `ReachCheck`, `FlightCheck` |
| Check names | `@CheckData(name="...")` | `name="Reach A"` |
| Stable keys | `windfall.category.name` | `windfall.combat.reach` |
| Test classes | `PascalCaseTest` | `ReachCheckTest` |
| Variables | `camelCase` | `playerVelocity` |

### Check Implementation Pattern

Every check must:

1. Extend `Check` (or implement `PacketCheck` for packet checks)
2. Annotate with `@CheckData` specifying name, stableKey, decay, setbackVl, version range
3. Handle all 6 version brackets (LEGACY through LATEST) where applicable
4. Use reflection for APIs not available in spigot-api 1.8
5. Clean up player data in `removePlayer(UUID)`

```java
@CheckData(
    name = "Reach A",
    stableKey = "windfall.combat.reach",
    decay = 0.05,
    setbackVl = 10
)
public class ReachCheck extends Check {
    // ...
}
```

### Thread Safety

- Use **immutable snapshot patterns** for shared state
- Publish state via `volatile` references
- Never synchronize on player state objects
- Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for player maps

### Compatibility

- **All code must compile against spigot-api 1.8** — even if it targets newer versions
- Use `ServerFork` and `VersionBracket` for version-specific behavior
- Use `@CheckData` compat flags for fork/version gating
- Use reflection for APIs added after 1.8 (e.g., `BlockData`, `PotionEffectType.getKey()`)

---

## Testing

### Requirements

- All **553 existing tests must pass** before submitting
- New checks should include unit tests
- Tests use JUnit 6.1.1 + Mockito 5.23.0

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Writing Tests

- Test class name: `<CheckName>Test.java`
- Location: `src/test/java/io/windfall/anticheat/`
- Mock `WindfallPlayer` and packet events
- Test both flagging (cheat detected) and reward (legitimate player)
- Test version-specific behavior where applicable

### Test Naming

```java
@Test
void testReachExceedsMaxDistance_flags() { ... }

@Test
void testReachWithinDistance_noFlag() { ... }
```

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include:

1. **Windfall version** (from `/windfall help` or plugin list)
2. **Server software and version** (e.g., Paper 1.21.4, Spigot 1.20.1)
3. **Java version** (`/version` output)
4. **Installed plugins** (especially PacketEvents version, ViaVersion, Geyser)
5. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
6. **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
7. **Console logs** (relevant errors or warnings)
8. **Config** (if modified from defaults)

### False Positives

False positive reports are especially valuable. When reporting:

- Describe the player action that triggered the false flag
- Include the check name from the alert message
- Share the console output showing the VL increase
- Note the player's MC version and connection type (Java/Bedrock)

---

## Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please open an issue with:

1. **Problem** — what cheat behavior isn't currently detected?
2. **Proposed solution** — how should the check work?
3. **Alternatives** — other approaches you've considered
4. **Compatibility** — which MC versions should it support?
5. **Priority** — how critical is this detection?

### New Check Proposals

For new anti-cheat checks, include:

- **Packet analysis** — which packets does the cheat modify?
- **Detection logic** — what mathematical or behavioral analysis catches it?
- **Thresholds** — what values distinguish cheats from legitimate play?
- **Edge cases** — pistons, elytra, swimming, ice, soul sand, etc.
- **False positive risks** — what legitimate behaviors might trigger it?

---

## Project Goals

Every contribution must serve one or both of these goals:

### Goal 1: Best Possible Detection Logic
- Pixel-accurate physics engine
- Zero false positives on legitimate players
- High confidence before flagging
- Precise setbacks (teleport to last safe position)

### Goal 2: Maximum Compatibility
- MC 1.7 through 26.2+
- Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, Folia, Purpur
- Java 11 through 26
- Java and Bedrock players (via Geyser/Floodgate)

**If a change conflicts with either goal, stop and discuss.**
